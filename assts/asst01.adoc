= Description

Design and create your own sketch using the Processing language/environment.
Think of yourself as a creative designer when choosing the topic of your
design. This is your very first program, so here are some guidelines.

Requirements:

* Make sure that it is *at least 500 pixels by 500 pixels*. The dimensions can vary depending upon your design, but make sure that it is not "small".
* Use each of the following drawing primitives at least once: *line, rect, ellipse, quad, beginShape/endShape, arc, curve*.
* Make liberal use of formatting commands, including: *background, no/stroke, no/fill*.
* Include proper source *code header* and adequate *comments*.
* Your program should call many built-in functions and *create a design*, as this is the point of this assignment.  A very "abstract" sketch like a simple circle in the center of the screen will not suffice (as aesthetic as it may seem). Here are some ideas:

** A self-portrait
** An avatar or a cartoon of someone
** Your favorite cartoon TV Show character or design your own...
** A city scape
** Animal/object caricatures/study
** A post card design
** A fabric pattern
** Stylize your name's initials...or a logo
** The Bryn Mawr Owl
** A Poster
** Imitation of existing design or art
** etc.

* Sign your work - the *course title* (CS110 Fall 2020) and *your name* should appear some where in the bottom of the sketch. Use the text() function and design your own signature.

= What to hand-in

. The program
. A write-up with your name, course and assignment number and a paragraph about the sketch, its inspiration, and how you designed and implemented it. Include a brief discussion about your experience working on this assignment.
. A jpg or png image of your finished sketch (use the `save()` function).

= Submission guidelines

Submit your program (entire sketch directory), write-up, and image as an electronic copy in the folder marked A01 in your dropbox folder.
