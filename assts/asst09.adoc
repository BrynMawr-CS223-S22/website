The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement an algorithm using multiple processes with fork()
* Compare single- and multi-process implementation performance
* Work with fork(), wait(), process ids, and shared memory

= Mandelbrot Set

The link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set[mandelbrot set] is fractal popularized by 
Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980. 

The mandelbrot set consists of the set of complex numbers z for which stem:[z^2 + c] does not diverge to infinity when z starts at 0. To visualize this set, recall that a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number[complex number], stem:[z = x + yi], can be visualized as a 2D point stem:[(x,y)]. Although the set derives from complex 
numbers, we can compute the set by thinking about 2D coordinates, stem:[(x,y)].

To see whether the complex number stem:[(x,y)] diverges, we simply need a loop that repeatedly computes stem:[z^2 + c]. If we expand the 
complex number multiplication of stem:[z = x + y*i], z will change each iteration based on the following algorith. To test for divergence, we check whether z goes 
out of the bounds of 4*4. If z does go out of bounds, we assign it a color based on how quickly it "escaped" the distance 4*4. If after MAX iterations, z is still 
smaller than 4*4, it belongs to the set and we color it black.

The last thing we need to draw the set is the region of values for x and y that bound the set. 
X should vary from -2.0 to 0.47. Y should vary from -1.12 to 1.12. Here is the full algorithm.
Assume that the image width and height are the same, e.g. square images.

for each row in the image
   for each col in the image
      xfrac = row / image_size
      yfrac = col / image_size
      x0 = xmin + xfrac * (xmax - xmin)
      y0 = ymin + yfrac * (ymax - ymin)

      x = 0
      y = 0
      iter = 0
      while (iter < MAX && x*x + y*y < 2*2) 
        xtmp = x*x - y*y + x0
        y = 2*x*y + y0
        x = xtmp

      if (iter < MAX) // escaped
        color = palette[iter]
      else
        color = black

      write color to image at location (row,col)

== Palette

The palette should contain the same number of colors as MAX iterations. 
Use `ppm_pixel` to represent colors in the pallet. You can either generate 
random colors or compute a base color and jitter it e.g. 

[cols="1a,1a"]

for each palette color
  red = rand() % 255
  green = rand() % 255
  blue = rand() % 255

basered = rand() % 255
basegreen = rand() % 255
baseblue = rand() % 255
for each palette color
  red = basered + rand() % 100 - 50
  green = basegreen + rand() % 100 - 50
  blue = baseblue + rand() % 100 - 50

= Single

In the file, `single_mandelbrot`, compute a program that outputs a PPM image of the mandelbrot 
set. You have been given basecode that initializes the following values from command line arguments. This code uses the link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getopt-function-in-c-to-parse-command-line-arguments/[getopt function].

Arguments:

* `-s <size>` the image width and height
* `-l <xmin>` the leftmost coordinate, e.g. minimum x value
* `-r <xmax>` the rightmost coordinate, e.g. maximum x value
* `-t <ymin>` the topmost coordinate, e.g. minimum y value
* `-b <ymax>` the bottommost coordinate, e.g. maximum y value

When you run your program, you should get the output such as the following

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make single_mandelbrot**
$ **./single_mandelbrot**
Generating mandelbrot with size 480x480
  X range = [-2.0000,0.4700]
  Y range = [-1.1200,1.1200]
Computed mandelbrot set (480x480) in 0.323261 seconds
Writing file: mandelbrot-480-1649001071.ppm
----

Requirements and hints:

* You should re-use your PPM functions from A06. If you use a 2D array of arrays, be sure to modify and commit `read_ppm.h`!
* Allocate an array of pixels using malloc and then save the final image using `write_ppm`.
* You should output the number of seconds needed to compute the image. Use this link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec17/matrix.c[class example, matrix.c] for an example. 
* Your output filename should have the format `mandelbrot-<size>-<timestamp>.png`. The timestamp can be obtained by calling `time(0)`.
* Set a random seed to ensure that the color palette is different each time, e.g. `srand(time(0))` 
* In your `README.adoc`, call `single_mandelbrot` with sizes of 100, 400, 800, 1000, and 2000. Record the number of seconds it takes to compute each image.
* (Optional) Experiment with visualizing other regions of the mandelbrot set. For example, if you run with `./single_mandelbrot -s 480 -l -0.02524993 -r 0.00975 -b -0.8172 -t -0.79725`, you get the following image

= Multiple

In the file, `multi_mandelbrot`, compute a program that outputs a PPM image of
the mandelbrot set using multiple processes spawned with `fork()`.  Your
basecode implements the same command line arguments in with `single_mandelbrot`.

Your program should use `shared memory` to split the computation of the image across 
4 child processes. After each child completes, the parent process should save the 
result to a file using `write_ppm`.

Requirements and hints:

* You should re-use your PPM functions from A06. If you use a 2D array of arrays, be sure to modify and commit `read_ppm.h`!
* Allocate an array of pixels using `shared memory` and then save the final image using `write_ppm`. Use the example from class as a reference.
* Print the pids and work tasks for each child.
* Refactor the code from `single_mandelbrot` to compute the mandelbrot set using a function. Then re-use the same function in both `single_mandelbrot.c` and `multi_mandelbrot.c`
* Use `fork()` to create 4 child processes and `wait()` to wait for each to complete.
* You should output the number of seconds needed to compute the image. Use this link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec17/matrix.c[class example, matrix.c] for an example.
