= Description

The goal of this assignment is to create an algorithmic artwork. 
Your submission should be *aesthetically pleasing*. 
Here are a few sources of inspiration:

* Mandala patterns
* String art
* Spirograph
* Robert Delaunay's paintings 

= Requirements

* You must use at least one *for-/while- loop* somewhere in your sketch. Preferably more!
* Your sketch must use trigonometry (`sin()` and `cos()`) or `rotate()`
* Your sketch should contain elements *radial symmetry*.
* Make sure your sketch includes your name and "CS110 Fall 2020" on the image

Your final submission should include a static image.

Recommendations:

* Make judicious use of colors. Experiment with transparency, jitter, gradients, and glow
* Use `random()` (or `noise()`) to create interesting variations. 

= What to hand-in

. The program (Don't forget your header comment!)
. A brief write-up  with your name, course and assignment number and a paragraph about the sketch, its inspiration, and how you designed and implemented it. Include a brief discussion about your experience working on this assignment.  
. An image (png,jpg) or animation (gif) of your finished sketch.

= Submission guidelines

Submit your program (entire sketch directory), write-up, and image as an electronic copy in the folder marked A04 in your dropbox folder.
