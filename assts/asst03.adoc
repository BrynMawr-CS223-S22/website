= {title}

**Due Friday, Feb 11, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Use malloc and free
* Work with 2D arrays
* Work with pointer-based data structures
* Use gdb and valgrind. 
* Work with different types of input: stdin, command line arguments, and files

**All programs must run without memory errors and leaks!**

= Magic Square

Implement a program, `magic_square.c`, that tests whether a given matrix is a magic square. 
A link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square[magic square] is an N by N matrix where each 
row, column, and diagonal has the same sum, called the _magic constant_.

----
$ **make magic_square**
gcc -g magic_square.c -o magic_square
$ **./magic_square < magic1.txt**
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
M is a magic square (magic constant = 15)
$ **./magic_square < magic2.txt**
9 1 6
3 5 7
4 8 2
M is NOT a magic square!
$ **./magic_square < magic3.txt**
1
M is a magic square (magic constant = 1)
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Read in the matrix from stdin using `scanf(" %d", &val);`. The first two values are the dimensions of the matrix. All subsequent integers are the values of the matrix. 
* Use malloc and free to allocate a 2D array to store the inputs.

= Sorted Snacks

Implement a program, `sorted_snackbar.c`, that allows users to add snacks to the snackbar and displays 
them in alphabetical order. Your program should have the same features as last week's snackbar, but should 
use a _linked list_ to store the snacks, rather than an array. 

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make sorted_snackbar**
gcc sorted_snackbar.c -o sorted_snackbar
$ **./sorted_snackbar**
Enter a number of snacks: **3**
Enter a name: **Slurm**
Enter a cost: **1.50**
Enter a quantity: **3**
Enter a name: **Beans**
Enter a cost: **5**
Enter a quantity: **1**
Enter a name: **Carrots**
Enter a cost: **2**
Enter a quantity: **10**

Welcome to Sorted Sally's Snack Bar.

0) Beans                cost: $5.00     quantity: 1
1) Carrots              cost: $2.00     quantity: 10
2) Slurm                cost: $1.50     quantity: 3
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Implement the function `insert_sorted`. This function should create a new snack struct and return the first item in the list
* Implement the function `clear`. This function should clear and free all items in the list.

= Matching braces 

Implement a program, `match_braces.c`, that takes a filename as a command line argument and uses a stack to check 
for matched braces and report any errors.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make match_braces**
gcc -g match_braces.c -o match_braces
$ **./match_braces**
usage: ./match_braces <filename>
$ **./match_braces prog.c**
Cannot open file: prog.c
$ **./match_braces prog1.c**
Found matching braces: (21, 32) -> (23, 5)
Found matching braces: (25, 30) -> (28, 9)
Found matching braces: (17, 53) -> (29, 5)
Unmatched brace on Line 31 and Column 1
Found matching braces: (40, 47) -> (43, 5)
Found matching braces: (36, 18) -> (47, 1)
Unmatched brace on Line 34 and Column 34
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Implement the functions `push`, `pop`, `clear`. Implementing `print` is also recommended to help you debug your assignment.
* Use link:https://diveintosystems.org/book/C2-C_depth/advanced_cmd_line_args.html[command line arguments] to input the filename. 
* Print the usage if the user inputs an incorrect number of command line arguments
* Print an error if your program cannot open the file
* Use `fgetc` to read the file one character at a time. Update the current line number when you encounter `\n`. Update the current column as you read in each character. 
* To check for matched braces, push to the stack when you encounter a '{' and then pop from the stack when you encounter '}'. If the symbols pushed and popped do not match, there is an error. 
* The output of the program should match the line and column numbers that Vim reports when you use `%` to check for matched braces. 

= Submit your Work

Push you work to github to submit your work.
