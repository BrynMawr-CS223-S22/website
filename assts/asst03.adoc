= Description

The goal of this assignment is to create your own drawing program. 

* Support multiple brush types (line, circle, and one of your own choosing)
* Support multiple brush sizes (no smaller than size 1)
* Support multiple colors (at least three) 
* Saving an image 
* Clearing an image

== Requirements

* Your program should accept the following *key input*
** The 's' key should save the current canvas as an image. Use the `save` function.
** The 'c' key should clear the canvas. Hint: use the `background` function.
** The '1' key should switch to the line brush
** The '2' key should switch to the circle brush
** The '3' key should switch to the custom brush
** The 'UP' key should increase the brush size
** The 'DOWN' key should decrease the brush size. The brush size should not be allowed to go smaller than 1.
* You program should have *circle buttons* for changing the current color 
** Check whether the user clicked inside any of the pallet buttons. If yes, change the current color to the pallet button's color.
* Your *UI features* should include
** Text to show the current brush and brush size
** A shape to show the current color
** Circle buttons for choosing the current color 
** The shapes and coordinates for the shown demo are given in the next section. Feel free to use it if you like.
* *Line Brush*: draw a line using mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, and pmouseY. See example 3-4 in the textbook. 
** strokeWidth should match the current brush size
** stroke should match the current color
* *Circle brush*: draw a circle at the current mouseX, mouseY position. See the jitter/gradient examples from week 1 for an example.
** Your choice whether to use stroke or not
** circle size should match the current brush size
** circle fill should match the current color
* *Custom brush*: a brush of your choosing. You can combine multiple shapes, jitter the colors, or use transparency. In the above example, the brush has a quad shape centered at mouseX and mouseY.
** Your choice whether to use stroke/fill or not
** shape size should be based on the current brush size
** shape color should match the current color

== Recommendations

* Define variables to store the following information
** A variable to store the current color (data type: color)
** A variable to store the current brush size (data type: float)
** A variable to store the current brush type (data type: String)
** These variables can be global or local. It's up to you.
* In `draw()` 
** Do not call background to clear the screen. Instead, re-draw the user interface on top of the previous frame.
** To draw the user interface:
*** Draw a rectangle to serve as the background for the pallet. Then draw the pallet buttons on top. 
*** Draw a rectangle to serve as the background for the brush information. Then draw the brush information.
