Due Friday, April 22

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement multi-thread algorithms using the pthread library

= Threaded

Implement a multi-threaded version of the mandelbrot set that you implemented for link:asst09.html[Assignment 09].

In the file, `thread_mandelbrot.c`, compute a program that outputs a PPM image of the mandelbrot 
set. You have been given basecode that initializes the following values from command line arguments. This code uses the link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getopt-function-in-c-to-parse-command-line-arguments/[getopt function].

Arguments:

* `-s <size>` the image width and height
* `-l <xmin>` the leftmost coordinate, e.g. minimum x value
* `-r <xmax>` the rightmost coordinate, e.g. maximum x value
* `-t <ymin>` the topmost coordinate, e.g. minimum y value
* `-b <ymax>` the bottommost coordinate, e.g. maximum y value

When you run your program, you should get the output such as the following

Computed mandelbrot set (480x480) in 0.143906 seconds
Writing file: mandelbrot-480-1650116924.ppm
----

Requirements and hints:

* You should re-use your PPM and mandelbrot functions from A09. If you use a 2D array of arrays, be sure to modify and commit `read_ppm.h`!
* Create four threads. Each thread should process a quadrant of the image.
* Print the ids and work tasks for each thread. You can print either the pthread_t ID, or your own given id. Above, we print the pthread_t ID. See the code from class for examples.
* Allocate an array of pixels using malloc and then save the final image using `write_ppm`.
* Do not declare global variables! Use parameters to send data to each thread's start_routine.
* You should output the number of seconds needed to compute the image. Use this link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec17/matrix.c[class example, matrix.c] for an example. The performance should be comparable to your multi_mandelbrot version from A09.
* Your output filename should have the format `mandelbrot-<size>-<timestamp>.ppm`. The timestamp can be obtained by calling `time(0)`.
* Set a random seed to ensure that the color palette is different each time, e.g. `srand(time(0))` 

= Buddhabrot

In the file, `buddhabrot.c`, compute a program that outputs a PPM image of
the Buddhabrot using multiple threads.  

The link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot[Buddhabrot] visualizes the trajectory of each point (x,y) 
as it escapes the mandelbrot set. The color of each pixel represents the probability of a point (x,y) 
visiting it while we calculate whether or not it belongs to the mandelbrot set.

Computing the Buddhabrot set requires three steps:

* First, determine whether a point is in the mandelbrot set. Recall the points within the set remain less than 2*2 and are given a black color. Store whether a point escapes as a boolean in its own 2D array.
* Second, for the points that _do_ escape, you must update counts for each (x,y) coordinate visited. Store these counts in its own 2D array. Also keep track of the max count for any pixel.
* Third, you must turn the counts from step 2 into a color. The final colors should be written to a 2D array of ppm_pixel (either flat or an array of arrays) and then written. 

Each of the above steps can be parallelized using threads. The second step will require a mutex to ensure that the counts are set correctly. Below are suggested algorithms for 
computing each step. Each algorithm should be its own start_routine for your threads.

**Step 1: Determine mandelbrot set membership**

----
for each row in the image
   for each col in the image
      xfrac = row / image_size
      yfrac = col / image_size
      x0 = xmin + xfrac * (xmax - xmin)
      y0 = ymin + yfrac * (ymax - ymin)

      x = 0
      y = 0
      iter = 0
      while (iter < MAX && x*x + y*y < 2*2) 
        xtmp = x*x - y*y + x0
        y = 2*x*y + y0
        x = xtmp
        iter++

      if (iter < MAX) // escaped
        set membership at (row,col) to false
      else
        set membership at (row,col) to true

**Step 2: Compute visited counts**
[source]
----
for each row in the image
   for each col in the image
      if (row,col) belongs to the mandelbrot set, continue

      xfrac = row / image_size
      yfrac = col / image_size
      x0 = xmin + xfrac * (xmax - xmin)
      y0 = ymin + yfrac * (ymax - ymin)

      x = 0
      y = 0
      iter = 0
      while (iter < MAX) 
        xtmp = x*x - y*y + x0
        y = 2*x*y + y0
        x = xtmp

        yrow = round((height - 1) * (y - ymin)/(ymax - ymax))
        xcol = round((width - 1) * (x - xmin)/(xmax - xmax))
        if (yrow < 0 || yrow >= height) continue; // out of range
        if (xcol < 0 || xcol >= width) continue; // out of range

        increment count at (yrow, xcol) 
        update max count

        iter++

**Step 3: Compute colors**
[source]
----
gamma = 0.681
factor = 1.0/gamma
for each row in the image
   for each col in the image
      value = 0

      if counts at (row,col) are greater than zero
        value = log(counts[row][col]) / log(max_count)
        value = pow(value, factor)

      color.red = value * 255
      color.green = value * 255
      color.blue = value * 255

      write color to image at location (row,col)

Requirements and hints:

* You should re-use your PPM and mandelbrot functions from A09. If you use a 2D array of arrays, be sure to modify and commit `read_ppm.h`!
* Each thread should run all three steps on a quadrant of the image. 
* You will need a `pthread_barrier_t` to wait for all counts to be computed before computing the colors
* Notice that the range of x and y might need to be larger to see the probability distribution
* Use mutex to compute the counts
* You should output the number of seconds needed to compute the image. Use this link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec17/matrix.c[class example, matrix.c] for an example. 
* Your output filename should have the format `buddhabrot-<size>-<timestamp>.ppm`. The timestamp can be obtained by calling `time(0)`.
* You may use global variables for this program. 

NOTE: Above, we compute a greyscale mandelbrot. To add colors, compute counts for the red, green, and blue channels separately, using different values for maxIterations in each. For example the following image used 5000 for red, 500 for green, and 50 for blue.

NOTE: Other chaotic sets can be visualized in the same way as the Buddhabrot. To see more, read about link:https://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf[Fractal Frames].
