**Part 1 Due Monday, November 2, before midnight**

**Part 2 Due Friday, November 6, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Define and use functions and objects
* Design a larger program

= Description

The goal of this assignment is to create your own arcade game. It should support 
numerous obstacles and a single player controlled with the keyboard. An example 
with basic game mechanics is shown below.

And here is an example with a theme applied

= Requirements

* You must define a Obstacle class having methods `update()`, `draw()`, and `intersects(Player player)`
* You must define a Player class having methods draw(), moveLeft(), moveRight(), moveUp(), moveDown(), x(), y(), width(), and height()
* Your game should define many obstacles using an array
* In draw(), you should update the player based on the keyboard, draw objects, and check for intersections 
* Use the `random` function to modify the behavior of obstacles each time you play
* Your game should have a 'game over' condition
* You should implement your own unique theme for the background, player, and obstacles. 
* You should implement at least one unique game mechanic. Some ideas:
** Allow the player to get hit multiple times before 'game over'
** Make the goal of the game to hit as many obstacles as possible, rather than avoid them
** Add powerups
** Randomize the appearance of enemies
** Implement projectiles
** Implement your own obstacles. For example, they don't need to be circles. You could do a series of walls. 
** Implement a win condition. You can keep track of how many seconds the user plays, or stop once the player collects a certain number of items.
** Increase the difficulty over time
** Modify how obstacles move. They could oscillate or change direction. 

Use the resources below to help you implement your game:

* link:https://www.cs.brynmawr.edu/~alinen/lab-website/cs110/notes/week07.html#_collisions[Collision example]

Ideas to help with debugging and implementation:

* If a feature might be difficult, implement it in a separate program before integrating it into your game. For example, you can implement a Player class and test it in its own program. Then you can copy the Player code into your game sketch.
* Implement the core game without a theme to start
* Implement a reset feature to make it easy to restart your game for testing

= What to hand-in

* PART 1 (Due Nov 2, by midnight)* 

. Your program with working Player and Obstacle classes implemented. You do not need to have intersection testing complete. Your submission should have your background and theme implemented. When I run your program, I should be able to control the player character and see the obstacles drawn to the screen.  
. Your program should have a header comment and should run without errors. 

* PART 2 (Due Nov 6, by midnight)*

. The complete program, including intersection tests, win condition, and unique game mechanic (Don't forget your header comment!)
. A brief write-up  with your name, course and assignment number and a few sentences about the unique features of your game. 
. An animation (gif or video) of your finished sketch

= Submission guidelines

Submit your program (entire sketch directory), write-up, and image as an electronic copy in the folder marked A05 in your dropbox folder.
