= Description

The goal of this assignment is to create an interactive star map with constellations.

= Requirements

1) Define a class, called `Star`, to represent each star on the map

* `Star` contains the following data: 
** x coordinate (float between 0 and 1000)
** y coordinate (float between 0 and 1000), and 
** brightness (float between 0 and 1.0, where 1.0 is most bright and 0.0 is dim)
* `Star` contains the two methods:
** constructor with parameters for x, y, and brightness
** draw method. In the picture above, brighter stars are bigger and have a brighter color.

2) Define a class, called `Constellation`, to represent each constellation line on the map.

* `Constellation` contains the following data: 
** name of the constellation (String) 
** starting x coordinate (float between 0 and 1000)
** starting y coordinate (float between 0 and 1000), 
** ending x coordinate (float between 0 and 1000),
** ending y coordinate (float between 0 and 1000), 
* `Constellation` contains the following methods:
** constructor with parameters for name, and the starting and ending points
** `draw` method. This function should draw a line between the starting and ending points. 
** `getName` method. This method should return the name of the constellation. 
** `intersects` method. This function should return true if the mouse is within 25 units of one of the endpoints of the constellation line. 

3) In setup, you should read and parse the file `stars-cs110.txt`. Use the function `loadStrings` to load the file into an array of String. Each line in the file stores the x,y,brightness values, separated by commas. For each line, create a Star object and save it in an array of Star.

4) In setup, you should read and parse the file `constellations-cs110.txt`. Use the function `loadStrings` to load the file into an array of String. Each line in the file stores the name,x1,y1,x2,y2 of the constellation line. For each line, create a Constellation object and save it in an array of Constellation. 

5) In draw, draw your stars and constellations. For each constellation, check whether the mouse is over a constellation. If it is, display its name at the current mouse position. 

= Starter code

You have basecode for this assignment. Check dropbox.

= What to hand-in

. The complete program (Don't forget your header comment!)
. A brief write-up with your name, course and assignment number and a few sentences about anything you found challenging about the assignment. 

= Submission guidelines

Submit your program (entire sketch directory), write-up, and image as an electronic copy in the folder marked A05 in your dropbox folder.
