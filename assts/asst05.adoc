= {title}

**Due Friday, February 25, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Understand binary representations of data types
* Directly manipulate basic types at the bit level
* Work with bitwise operators: |, &, ~, ^
* Work with binary files

**All programs must run without memory errors and leaks!**

:sectnums:

= Four letter words

In the program, `word.c`, implement a program that asks the user for a 4-letter word 
and stores the characters within a single `unsigned int`. 

[source,subs="quotes"]
$ **./word**
Enter 4 characters: love
Debug: e = 0x00000065
Debug: v = 0x00007600
Debug: o = 0x006F0000
Debug: l = 0x6C000000
Your number is: 1819244133 (0x6c6f7665)
$ **./word**
Enter 4 characters: !@#$
Debug: $ = 0x00000024
Debug: # = 0x00002300
Debug: @ = 0x00400000
Debug: ! = 0x21000000
Your number is: 557851428 (0x21402324)
----

Requirements/Hints:

* You can assume the user enters a valid 4-letter word
* For debugging, print the hexadecimal values of each character, shifted to its correct spot

= Binary to ASCII

In the program, `binarychar.c`, implement a program that asks the user for an 8-bit 
binary number and outputs the corresponding character.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make binarychar**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror binarychar.c -o binarychar
$ **./binarychar**
Enter 8 bits: 01100001
Your character is: a
$ **./binarychar**
Enter 8 bits: 01111100
Your character is: |
----

Requirements/Hints:

* You can assume that the user enters a valid 8-bit binary number

= Read raw

In the file, `read_ppm.c`, implement a modified version of your PPM reader from 
link:asst04.html[Assignment 04] that reads PPM files in _binary_ format, 
rather than _ascii_ format.

In raw format, the header information is still ASCII (although the magic number is "P6", not "P3"), 
but the pixel data is in binary format. Use `fread` to read in the pixels. 

Use `test_ppm.c` to again test that your reader is working

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make test_ppm**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror test_ppm.c read_ppm.c -o test_ppm
$ **./test_ppm**
Testing file feep-raw.ppm: 4 4
(0,0,0) (100,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,0,255)
(0,0,0) (0,255,175) (0,0,0) (0,0,0)
(0,0,0) (0,0,0) (0,15,175) (0,0,0)
(255,0,255) (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,255,255)
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Remember to open the file with "rb", not "r"
* Use `fread` to copy all the pixel data into your array as one large block
* If you needed to modify the function signature in `ppm_read` because you allocated an array of arrays, be sure to update `read_ppm.h` here as well. **Just be careful to keep the new definition of ppm_pixel**!

= Glitch

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art[Glitch Art] is the practice of leveraging technological errors for artistic purposes. Some cool examples can be found here by link:https://mobile.twitter.com/glitchartbot[glitchartbot].

First, implement a new function, `write_ppm`, defined in `read_ppm.c`. Similarly to link:asst04.html[Assignment 04], you should change the definition of `write_ppm` if you use an "array of arrays" to store your pixels. **Be careful that you do not change the definition of ppm_pixel!**

Then write a program, `glitch.c`, that reads in a PPM file and "glitches" it. Your program should save the modified PPM in a new file with the suffix "-glitch". For example, if you load in the file 
"monalisa.ppm", you should output a file named "monalisa-glitch.ppm".

Requirements/Hints:

* Implement a function to write your PPM as a _binary_ file, e.g. with the option "wb".
* Use `fwrite` to write to your file.
* Save the result to `<filename>-glitch.ppm`
* To start, implement a minimal glitch, which shifts each color value by either 1 or 2 bits, choosen at random, e.g. `newcolorvalue = oldcolorvalue << (rand() % 2);`. Your result should look like
* Submit your glitched images as part of your submission!

Feel free to be creative with your glitches. You can use a combination of bit operations, switching colors, adding colors, etc.  Anything goes! Also, feel free to use your own images. PPM images can be exported using link:https://www.gimp.org[Gimp] or Photoshop.
