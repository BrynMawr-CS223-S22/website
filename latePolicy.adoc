=== Late Policy

Because practice is so important for learning how to program, we will do frequent 
exercises, assignments, and quizzes throughout the term.

The purpose of this work is to give you hands on experience with the topics
from class. Most of this work will be due in lecture or labs. The  
weekly time commitment for this course is aimed to be 10 hours or less per week.

Assignments will generally be due on Fridays. However, you may request a late 
day (until Saturday) if necessary. No submissions beyond Saturday will be accepted.
This allows us time to grade assignments. And it helps prevent you from falling 
behind.

If you need to miss a quiz, let the instructor know and alternate arrangements for 
taking it will be arranged if possible. 

You may need to provide a doctor's note if you need special accomodations due to a 
medical emergency.
