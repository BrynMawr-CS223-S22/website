Code Jams are open book. 40 minutes in lab.

Topics:

Everything from link:studyguide1.html[Study Guide 1], plus

* valgrind/gdb
* Common memory errors
* Reading and writing text files
* 2D arrays

Write C programs to check your answers. Or you can ask a TA or instructor 
to give feedback on your responses.

= Practice questions

1) When Bella runs valgrind on her program, she receives the following error

[source]
----
==2017== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
==2017==    at 0x483EF49: strlen (in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==2017==    by 0x1091D4: main (memerr.c:6)
----

Here is her code

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char name[16];
  for (int i = 0; i < strlen(name)-1; i++) {
    name[i] = i+'a';
  }
  name[15] = '\0';
  printf("Name is %s\n", name);
  return 0;
}
----

What does the valgrind error mean and how can Bella fix her program?

2) When Garfield runs valgrind on his program, he received the following error

[source]
----
free(): double free detected in tcache 2
Aborted
----

Here is his code.

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  FILE* fp = fopen("test.txt", "r");
  if (!fp) {
    printf("Cannot open file\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  int ch = 0;
  while (ch != EOF) {
    ch = fgetc(fp);
  }
  fclose(fp);
  free(fp);
  fp = NULL;
}

3) When Billie runs their program it crashes with the following error.

Here is their program

int initfunc(int *array, int len) {

    return 0;

    for (i=1; i <= len; i++) {
        if (max < array1[i]) {
            max = array1[i];
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    int *arr = NULL;
    int max = 6;

    if (initfunc(arr, 100) != 0 ) {
        printf("init error\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    if ( func(arr, 100, max) != 0 ) {
        printf("func error\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    printf("max value in the array is %d\n", max);
    exit(0);

Let's help Billie use GDB to find and fix their crash.

* What command do we use to debug Billie's program using GDB?
* What GDB command can we use to run the program?
* When we run, the program stops with the following error. What GDB command can we use to find the function and line where the program stopped?
[source]
----
Starting program: /home/billie/cs223/a.out

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00005555555551b8 in initfunc ()
----
* The GDB terminal does not show human readable symbols. How do we fix this?
* What GDB command can we use to place a breakpoint at the start of the functions `main` and `initfunc`?
* What GDB command can we use to execute the next line?
* How do you print the parameters of `initfunc`?
* What line of the program contains the error? Is it the same line as the crash? What is happening and how can Billie fix their program?

4) Draw the function stack and heap for the following program. 

* Draw the stack and heap the first time the line labeled A is reached
* Draw the stack and heap the first time the line labeled B is reached
* Draw the stack and heap the first time the line labeled C is reached

struct link {
  char name[16];
  struct link* children[4];
};

struct link* create(const char* name, struct link* parent) {
  struct link* limb = malloc(sizeof(struct link));
  strncpy(limb->name, name, 15);
  // A) Draw function stack here
  return limb;
}

void clear(struct link* body[], int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    free(body[i]);
    body[i] = NULL;
  }
  // C) Draw function stack here
}

int main() {

  struct link* body[4];

  body[0] = create("root", NULL);
  body[1] = create("head", body[0]);
  body[2] = create("left arm", body[0]);
  body[3] = create("right arm", body[0]);
  // B) Draw function stack here

  clear(body, 4);
  return 0;

5) Write a program that reads in a text file and writes it to a new file with each word reversed. 

6) Write a program that swaps the first and last element of a linked list.

7) Write a program that inserts nodes to a binary tree. Add a function that also prints the nodes of the tree using pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.
