== Course Info

**Welcome to CS223: Systems Programming**! 


Systems programming provides a foundation for the implementation of programs and
toolkits that serve as infrastructure for other software, such as compilers,
operating systems, networking APIs, and graphics engines.  Topics include
pointers, bit representations of data, x86_64 assembly, memory management,
processes, and threads.  In this class, students will gain hands-on experience
implementing low-level algorithms and data structures using C.  Furthermore,
students will build technical skills related to makefiles, interactive
debugging, version control, and command-line shell interaction. C++ and STL
will be introduced at the end of the course.

=== Course Preview

You will write C programs for most of your assignments, working with linked lists, arrays, bitwise operators, and files. 
We will also work at the bit-level with images in PPM format. Below are several examples.
